                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <h4>Washtenaw Community College <small>2010 - Present</small></h4>
                    <h4>Certificate Obtained: <small>Certificate in Web Technology (CTWBTC)</small></h4>

                    <h4>Jetti Systems, Design/Development Lead: <br><small>April 2014 - Present</small></h4>
                    <p>In April of 2014, I co-founded a SaaS company that develops mobile-based web applications for the restaurant industry. Within our small team I serve as the lead technical and design officer responsible for creation and development of all digital and physical deliverables. This includes designing and developing all user, client and administration interfaces, company websites, promotional materials, managing social media properties, branding, and interfacing with our backend development team. The nature of the business has required me to develop a workflow that is both rapid and agile. It is not uncommon for concepts to go from whiteboard to production within a few weeks. A major challenge in the development of our service has been balancing the needs of end-users, stakeholders and our company. This has lead us to develop a system that provides both an excellent user experience for the end-user as well as a flexible tool for our clients. Our service is currently live and running in multiple locations.</p>

                    <h4>Washtenaw Community College, JATC669 Web Administrator: <br><small>October 2014 - Present</small></h4>
                    <p>As web administrator I manage the front-end of the JATC669 Sprinkler Fitter Apprentice Education course management website and function as the lead technical advisor for the program. In addition to maintaining the program’s LMS (Moodle), I also serve as the liaison to WCC’s I.T. Department regarding Banner dependencies. My focus in this position has been to update physically delivered student materials to web-based solutions including transferring video content to a centralized online repository, recreating student documents in a digital and mobile-friendly format, and developing in-house tools to improve the workflow of the department. I have also been asked to advise content creators in design best practices and content delivery methods.</p>

                    <h4>CCWD, Freelance Web Design and Development: <br><small>February 2010 - Present</small></h4>
                    <p>Over the course of the past five years, I have designed and developed multiple web-based projects and have offered my services to clients as a UX and SEO consultant to several organizations. During this time, I also served as the front-end web developer for the SPRING Creative Group (now defunct) within the SPARK East Business Incubator in Ypsilanti, MI. A major accomplishment for me was assuming the management role of a local entertainment venue’s website where I performed a thorough analysis of their current site, designed and developed a new, content-rich and mobile-friendly solution that resulted in dropping their web traffic bounce-rate from 90% to 6% and secured first-page SERP for their critical keywords.</p>

                    <h4>Washtenaw Community College, Student Response Device Administrator:<br><small>February 2009 - October 2014</small></h4>
                    <p>In early 2009, I was hired by Washtenaw Community College to assist with the implementation of TurningPoint student response devices on campus. Being a pilot program, I was required to assess the software's capabilities, develop an implementation strategy, and instruct and assist faculty in the use of the software. In 2011, I helped develop a new distribution and implementation system for the technology. I also created and maintained a website for students and faculty to receive instruction on using the system.</p>

                    <h4>LMG Show Technology,  Quality Control Technician: <br><small>February 2009 - October 2014</small></h4>
                    <p>I was hired by LMG, one of the largest event technology providers in the country, to work as a Video Quality Control Technician at the largest of their three branches located in Las Vegas. My responsibilities were to examine and test high-end video production and presentation equipment such as projectors, monitors, switchers and playback devices as well as prep orders for LMG’s show technicians. This position provided me with hands-on experience with top of the line professional gear and the opportunity to work with professionals in the top of their field.</p>

                    <h4>Video Production Professional: <br><small>September 2001 - January 2008</small></h4>
                    <p>During this time period I worked as a Video Production Professional in a variety of roles for a diverse set of clients.</p>
