In addition to maintaining the program’s LMS (Moodle), I also serve as the liaison to WCC’s I.T. Department.</p>
                    <p>My focus in this position has been to identify and eliminate inefficiencies in the delivery and user experience of the distance-learning program and to simplify the onboarding process of new apprentices.</p>   
                    <p>This includes streamlining the delivery of physical materials to web-based eLearning solutions including transferring video content to a centralized online repositories, digitizing printed content, and ensuring that our platform is presented in a responsive and accessible way based on the needs of our apprentices.</p> 
                    <p>I have also been an advocate for improving the content creation workflow within our office. I have advised and implemented a version control solution that has both reduced the time spent developing new materials as well as improved the overall value of the content.</p>

                    <h4>Jetti Systems, Design/Development Lead: <br><small>February 2014 - September 2017</small></h4>
                    <p>In April of 2014, I co-founded a SaaS company that developed mobile-based web marketing applications for the restaurant industry. Within our small team I served as the lead technical and design officer responsible for creation and development of all digital and physical deliverables. This included designing and developing all user, client and administration interfaces, company websites, promotional materials, managing social media properties, branding, and interfacing with our backend development team.</p>
                    <p>The nature of the business required our team to develop workflows that were both rapid and agile. It was common for concepts to go from whiteboard to production within a matter of days. A major challenge in the development of our service was balancing the needs of end-users, stakeholders, and our company. This led us to develop a system that provided both an excellent user experience for the end-user as well as a flexible tool for our clients.</p> 
                    <p>At its peak, Jetti Rewards had thousands of active users at over a dozen restaurants, including independents and small franchises. The program achieved a 23% repeat-user rate, with 142 monthly check-ins per location, and a ticket increase in 43% of use-related sales.</p>
